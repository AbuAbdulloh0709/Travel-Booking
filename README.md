# Travel Booking Spring Boot Application

## Introduction

Creating a Travel Booking Application with third-party libraries using Spring Boot RESTful API. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Overview

The second time was super easy to create the application with the assistance of ChatGPT. The process took approximately 1.5 hours,
even the task is harder than the previous one.

## Code Readiness

The generated code wasn't ready to run initially, as it suggested some outdated implementations for Spring Boot. However, the provided examples and detailed guidance helped in making necessary updates for a functional application.

## Challenges

I did not face any hard challenges during the implementation, and the development process was smooth.

## Good Practices

Several good practices I have learned, including giving detailed examples for better understanding and implementation.

## Instructions to Run the Application

1. [Replace with any specific setup instructions if needed]

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
